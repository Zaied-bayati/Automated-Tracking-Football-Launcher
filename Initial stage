All of this started with a simple question:
How can I train as a wide receiver without relying on someone else to throw me the football?

Right now, the options online are either cheap toys or overpriced JUGS-style machines. Even with a ball machine, you still need another person to aim it and feed the ball through two massive spinning tires. To me, that completely defeats the purpose.

So I started thinking differently.

What if I could build a football launcher that tracks me, predicts where I’ll be, and throws the ball to me automatically—no extra person required? A system that acts like a quarterback, not just a machine. That felt like a real problem worth tackling.

This project is the beginning of that idea. Here, I’ll walk through the initial stages of building it.


Constraints

As a broke college student, building a full-scale system just wasn’t realistic. But a smaller prototype was. The goal wasn’t perfection—it was to prove the concept works. If I could demonstrate accuracy, tracking, and repeatability at a smaller scale, scaling up becomes a solvable problem later.

So before building anything, I defined some clear design goals.


Design Goals

1.) Use a smaller football (around half the size of an NFL football)

2.) Launch the ball accurately, with enough speed and spin to mimic a real QB throw

3.) Track the player by estimating distance, size, and speed to make accurate throws

4.) Collect player data in real time so routes can be analyzed and improvements can be tracked over time

5.) Keep the system small and compact—portable enough to fit in a backpack
Gone are the days of bulky, old-generation JUGS machines

6.) Make the system simple and user-friendly
