All of this started with a simple question:
How can I train as a wide receiver without relying on someone else to throw me the football?

Right now, the options online are either cheap toys or overpriced JUGS-style machines. Even with a ball machine, you still need another person to aim it and feed the ball through two massive spinning tires. To me, that completely defeats the purpose.

So I started thinking differently.

What if I could build a football launcher that tracks me, predicts where I’ll be, and throws the ball to me automatically—no extra person required? A system that acts like a quarterback, not just a machine. That felt like a real problem worth tackling.

This project is the beginning of that idea. Here, I’ll walk through the initial stages of building it.


Constraints

As a broke college student, building a full-scale system just wasn’t realistic. But a smaller prototype was. The goal wasn’t perfection—it was to prove the concept works. If I could demonstrate accuracy, tracking, and repeatability at a smaller scale, scaling up becomes a solvable problem later.

So before building anything, I defined some clear design goals.


Design Goals

1.) Use a smaller football (around half the size of an NFL football)

2.) Launch the ball accurately, with enough speed and spin to mimic a real QB throw

3.) Track the player by estimating distance, size, and speed to make accurate throws

4.) Collect player data in real time so routes can be analyzed and improvements can be tracked over time

5.) Keep the system small and compact—portable enough to fit in a backpack
Gone are the days of bulky, old-generation JUGS machines

6.) Make the system simple and user-friendly

This is just the beginning—but it’s the foundation for something much bigger.



The first step was simple: test the idea.
Since portability was a core goal, I didn’t want to copy the traditional JUGS-machine approach of using two massive motors and large spinning tires. That design works, but it’s bulky, heavy, and not something you throw in a backpack.

Instead, I asked a different question:
Could multiple smaller DC motors achieve the same result as two large ones?

If six small motors could deliver enough speed, control, and consistency, then a compact launcher suddenly becomes realistic.
With that in mind, I designed an initial proof-of-concept test.
The setup was a tube-style launcher, where the football would be pushed straight through a channel. The purpose of this test wasn’t perfection—it was feasibility. Before spending time building software, tracking systems, and control logic, I needed to know one thing:
Could this launcher realistically achieve the distance and accuracy I was aiming for?
If the hardware couldn’t deliver, nothing else would matter.
Here’s what I came up with.

#Test One
Simple tube launcher with three DC motors and three small drive wheels, aligned straight to propel the ball forward
