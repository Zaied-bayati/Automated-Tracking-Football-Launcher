Stage Four – Failure, Reflection, and Real Engineering

At this point, the football launcher works. What started as a simple idea has turned into something I can test, break, improve, and rebuild—and honestly, this is the part of engineering that excites me the most.

There are infinite solutions to this problem. I could have built this system hundreds of different ways, using countless materials and designs. But that realization reminded me of a famous quote—paraphrased—from Michelangelo:

When he looked at a block of marble, he didn’t see stone.
He saw the masterpiece hidden inside it.
His job wasn’t to sculpt, but to reveal what was already there.

That idea stuck with me.

When I started this project, I had basic electrical engineering skills. By the time I reached this stage, I wasn’t just learning circuits or mechanics—I was learning engineering as a whole. Creating a puzzle and then solving it yourself is its own form of art. Engineering is art.

What Happened in Stage Four?

With a lot more confidence, I took a major leap in design—and with it came a lot of problems.

After about 8–10 launches, the 3D-printed PLA tube failed. It cracked, and one of the tires went flying. Surprisingly, this felt like a good sign. A few months earlier, nothing was breaking—because nothing existed yet. Failure meant I was finally pushing the system hard enough to find its limits.

So I stepped back.

I collected the data I had, re-evaluated the design, learned more about Inventor Pro, and rethought how I was building everything. One major realization stood out: designing everything as a single solid piece was holding me back.

When something broke, I couldn’t just fix that part—I had to reprint the entire tube. That was slow, inefficient, and expensive.

Design Shift – Modular Thinking

Stage Four marked a shift to a parts-based design.

Instead of one large printed component, everything is now modular and connected using bolts. This change made a huge difference:

Broken parts can be replaced individually

Iteration is faster

Costs are lower

Design changes don’t require starting from scratch

This was a big step forward—not just for the launcher, but for me as a prototyper.

Lessons Learned

I also had to confront reality. Working a full-time job meant I only had weekends to build. Time became the most valuable resource. Optimizing iteration speed mattered just as much as optimizing performance.

I also learned that my X and Y axis movement, which relied on a servo, simply wasn’t strong enough for what I needed. That’s a problem to solve next—but now I know it’s a problem worth solving.

Enough talk.

This is Stage Four of the football launcher.
