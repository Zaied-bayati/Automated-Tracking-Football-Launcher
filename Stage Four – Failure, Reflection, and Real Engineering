Stage Four – Failure, Reflection, and Real Engineering

At this point, the football launcher works. What started as a simple idea has turned into something I can test, break, improve, and rebuild—and honestly, this is the part of engineering that excites me the most.

There are infinite solutions to this problem. I could have built this system hundreds of different ways, using countless materials and designs. But that realization reminded me of a famous quote—paraphrased—from Michelangelo:

When he looked at a block of marble, he didn’t see stone.
He saw the masterpiece hidden inside it.
His job wasn’t to sculpt, but to reveal what was already there.

That idea stuck with me.

When I started this project, I had basic electrical engineering skills. By the time I reached this stage, I wasn’t just learning circuits or mechanics—I was learning engineering as a whole. Creating a puzzle and then solving it yourself is its own form of art. Engineering is art.

What Happened in Stage Four?

With a lot more confidence, I took a major leap in design—and with it came a lot of problems.

After about 8–10 launches, the 3D-printed PLA tube failed. It cracked, and one of the tires went flying. Surprisingly, this felt like a good sign. A few months earlier, nothing was breaking—because nothing existed yet. Failure meant I was finally pushing the system hard enough to find its limits.

So I stepped back.

I collected the data I had, re-evaluated the design, learned more about Inventor Pro, and rethought how I was building everything. One major realization stood out: designing everything as a single solid piece was holding me back.

When something broke, I couldn’t just fix that part—I had to reprint the entire tube. That was slow, inefficient, and expensive.

Design Shift – Modular Thinking

Stage Four marked a shift to a parts-based design.

Instead of one large printed component, everything is now modular and connected using bolts. This change made a huge difference:

Broken parts can be replaced individually

Iteration is faster

Costs are lower

Design changes don’t require starting from scratch

This was a big step forward—not just for the launcher, but for me as a prototyper.

Lessons Learned

I also had to confront reality. Working a full-time job meant I only had weekends to build. Time became the most valuable resource. Optimizing iteration speed mattered just as much as optimizing performance.

I also learned that my X and Y axis movement, which relied on a servo, simply wasn’t strong enough for what I needed. That’s a problem to solve next—but now I know it’s a problem worth solving.

Enough talk.

This is Stage Four of the football launcher.

**Please see the provided video, which showcases the X-axis movement of the launcher. Two IR sensors are used as boundary limits, allowing the system to determine how far it   can safely rotate to the left and right.
  These sensors act as protective stops, preventing the launcher from over-rotating and causing damage—such as pulling on cables or stressing mechanical components.**


Huge jumps were made—both in the overall design and in how I interacted with the system.

At this point, I realized I could no longer rely on simple push buttons to test the launcher. The system had become too complex for that. I needed a more structured and reliable way to interface with it—something that would let me actually see what was happening inside the system while it was running.

That meant software.

To start simple and stay flexible, I chose serial communication between the C-based microcontroller and an external interface—my laptop (or, in fancier terms, a basic HMI). This allowed me to send commands, receive feedback, and debug behavior in real time without constantly rewiring hardware.

Using serial output gave me insight into:

- Motor states
- Timing and sequencing
- Launch logic
- System behavior during failures

More importantly, it helped me understand why the launcher was behaving the way it was—not just that it was behaving that way.
This marked a big shift in the project. The launcher wasn’t just hardware anymore—it was becoming a system.

Below are some screenshots showing what this interface looked like during testing.

At this point, everything was coming together. The design was solid, the movement system worked, and the software interface gave me real insight into what the launcher was doing.

The final step was simple: wire everything up and attempt the very first full launch.

Below is the video from that first complete test.

So… it failed.

I couldn’t even get a single launch off—and the reason was a simple design oversight. After spending so much time building the software and pushing toward a “full system” test, I missed one of the most fundamental questions:

Did the football actually have enough clearance to make it through the tube without hitting the side walls?

It didn’t.

That moment was frustrating, but also important. It exposed a blind spot in my process—and that’s exactly what prototyping is supposed to do.

As mentioned before, failure doesn’t mean going backward. It means progress is being made. The system was complex enough now that real limitations were showing themselves.

And progress was made.
