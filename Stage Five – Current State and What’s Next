Stage Five – Current State and What’s Next

At this point, this project became more than just a summer build. I genuinely see real-world potential in it. That said, reality set in.
Between only being able to work on the launcher on weekends and over the summer, I eventually ran out of time. School started back up, and my focus had to shift back to continuing my studies as an electrical engineering student at Texas Tech University.
This stage documents the final test, the current state of the system, and where I plan to take this project next—either in a future summer or when time allows.


What Changed

Based on the issues discovered in the previous stage, the fix itself was straightforward—thanks to one important design decision made earlier: modularity.
Because the launcher was now fully parts-based, I didn’t need to redesign or reprint the entire system. Instead, I was able to:

-Shorten the launch tube
-Increase internal clearance for the football
-Reduce the chance of the ball contacting the tube walls during launch

This change directly addressed the clearance issue that caused the Stage Four failure.
A quick redesign and reprint later, and the system was back in a testable state.

Current Status

With the updated tube and improved clearance, the launcher is once again operational and ready for testing. While this isn’t the final form of the system, it represents a solid stopping point given time constraints.

Below is a video showing the most recent design and test configuration.

---Technical Overview (Current State)---

Below is a high-level technical overview of the system as it exists today. I’m intentionally not including videos here—the system still works, but many parts are crude and need refinement before I feel comfortable showcasing them publicly.

---Mechanical System---

The mechanical side of the launcher is functional. The system can successfully launch a football and apply spin, although the results are still inconsistent. Distance, stability, and repeatability vary from launch to launch, which is expected at this stage.

---Controls and Software---

A PID controller is currently implemented on the Y-axis motor. Its main role is to act as a damper against vibrations caused by:
- Motor torque
- Sudden impulse forces during launch

Because the tube assembly is unbalanced, the DC motor must continuously apply force to hold the launcher at its commanded position. The PID loop handles this well, keeping the system stable during idle and launch events.

From a software standpoint, the control system works reliably:
- All commands are followed correctly
- Events are logged
- Real-time position data is streamed and visualized using position graphs
- At this stage, the software and control architecture are solid and extensible.

---Computer Vision---

The system uses a YOLOv8 model paired with a Logitech camera to implement basic computer vision. This allows the launcher to detect and track a human target.

The vision system is currently very crude:
- The camera has a narrow field of view
- Resolution is limited

However, for basic logic—
“person left → turn left”
“person right → turn right”
—it works reasonably well and serves as a proof of concept.


---Future Plans and Improvements---

Launch Consistency

The biggest mechanical weakness right now is the loading and launch mechanism. Currently, two DC motors with tires feed the football into the tube. While this can work, it’s inconsistent:

- The ball may hit the tube wall
- The ball may stall or fail to exit
- The ball may contact the housing

Additionally, the housing that holds the football can cause the ball to bind or stick.

Possible solutions include:
- Replacing the DC motor feed system with a linear actuator for consistent, controlled feeding
- Redesigning the football housing to be mechanically simpler and more rigid

Reducing variables during launch is critical. The more consistent the launch, the better the data—and the more effective the tracking and prediction software can become.

Distance Estimation

Right now, the vision system can only determine:
- Whether a person is present
- Whether they are left or right of the camera’s centerline

What the system does not know is distance—and that matters. Distance directly affects:
- Launch angle
- Motor speed
- Required spin

Potential solutions being considered:
- LiDAR
- Ultrasonic sensing
- RF-based distance estimation

There are many IoT-based approaches to this problem, and further research is needed to determine the most reliable and practical option.

Hardware Improvements

Additional planned upgrades include:
- Higher-quality DC motors
- Adding a third large drive tire

With only two tires, inconsistencies arise. A third contact point should improve grip, alignment, and launch repeatability.

---Long-Term Vision---

Once launch consistency and distance estimation are solved, attention will shift back to vision and prediction.

Camera improvements may include:
- A wider field-of-view lens
- Multiple cameras to cover a larger area

From there, the ultimate goal is prediction.
I want to train an AI model to understand wide receiver routes. This includes learning basic physics relationships such as:
- Player velocity and direction
- Launch power and angle
- Where the ball must be aimed so the receiver does not need to stop running

The plan is to use an LSTM-based deep learning model to track player movement and predict future position, allowing the launcher to aim ahead of the receiver—much like a real quarterback.

---Final Thoughts---

I don’t know what I don’t know—and I fully expect each step forward to introduce a new set of challenges. But with each iteration, I’m learning more than I ever could.
This project has been a real-world application of engineering concepts: mechanical design, controls, software, vision, and systems thinking—all working together.
