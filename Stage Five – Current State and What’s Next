Stage Five – Current State and What’s Next

At this point, this project became more than just a summer build. I genuinely see real-world potential in it. That said, reality set in.
Between only being able to work on the launcher on weekends and over the summer, I eventually ran out of time. School started back up, and my focus had to shift back to continuing my studies as an electrical engineering student at Texas Tech University.
This stage documents the final test, the current state of the system, and where I plan to take this project next—either in a future summer or when time allows.


What Changed

Based on the issues discovered in the previous stage, the fix itself was straightforward—thanks to one important design decision made earlier: modularity.
Because the launcher was now fully parts-based, I didn’t need to redesign or reprint the entire system. Instead, I was able to:

-Shorten the launch tube
-Increase internal clearance for the football
-Reduce the chance of the ball contacting the tube walls during launch

This change directly addressed the clearance issue that caused the Stage Four failure.
A quick redesign and reprint later, and the system was back in a testable state.

Current Status

With the updated tube and improved clearance, the launcher is once again operational and ready for testing. While this isn’t the final form of the system, it represents a solid stopping point given time constraints.

Below is a video showing the most recent design and test configuration.
