Stage Two – Introducing Spin

With the first test proving the idea wasn’t impossible, the next challenge was obvious: spin.

A football is an oddly shaped object, and without proper spin, it won’t fly straight. Instead, it flops through the air, creates excessive drag, and loses distance fast.
If this launcher was ever going to mimic a real quarterback, spin had to be part of the equation.

The goal of Stage Two was to see how angling the DC motors would affect the spin of the football during launch.
Rather than pushing the ball straight through the tube, I adjusted the motor angles so the wheels applied a rotational force as the ball passed through.
This test wasn’t about perfect spirals or max distance—it was about understanding whether controlled spin was even achievable with this setup.
That small design change marked a big shift: the launcher was no longer just throwing the ball—it was starting to throw it correctly.
