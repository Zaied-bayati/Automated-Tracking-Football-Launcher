Stage Three – Balancing Spin and Power

Good news first: the spin worked.

By angling the DC motors, the launcher was finally able to introduce controlled rotation to the football. From a physics standpoint, this made sense. Angling the motors effectively split the applied force into two components—one responsible for forward motion and the other for rotational motion.
Of course, this came with a tradeoff.

The football now lost a noticeable amount of its forward-driving force.
Why This Happened

From basic physics, we know that force can be resolved into x and y components. In the original straight-on design, all of the force was applied along a single axis, meaning 100% of the motor output went into pushing the football forward.
Once the motors were angled (around 35°), the same total force was now divided between:

A forward component (distance)
A rotational component (spin)

By conservation of energy, some of the force that previously contributed to distance was now being used to generate spin. The result was better flight stability—but reduced range.
Compensating for the Loss
At this point, the solution became obvious: add more force.

The design already allowed for six total DC motors, so instead of backing off the angle, I increased the available power. On top of that, I realized the small wheels I was using weren’t doing me any favors—they simply didn’t carry enough momentum.

Using Newton’s second law:

𝐹 = 𝑚⋅𝑎
F=m⋅a

If I wanted more force, increasing mass was one way to get there.

So I:

Switched to larger tires to increase effective mass and momentum
Allowed the motors more time to spin up to speed before feeding the football through
These changes helped recover much of the lost driving force while keeping the added spin.

Expanding the Design
With growing confidence that the launcher could both throw the ball and add proper spin, I decided to take a bigger leap in the design process: movement.

This stage involved a lot of iteration—printing, testing, reprinting, and repeating. That part isn’t glamorous, but it’s where the real progress happens.

Enough talk. Let’s get to the results.

Here’s Stage Three.
